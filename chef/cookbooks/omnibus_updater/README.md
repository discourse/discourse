OmnibusUpdater
==============

Update your omnibus! This cookbook can install the omnibus
Chef package into your system if you are currently running
via gem install, and it can keep your omnibus install up
to date.

Usage
=====

Add the recipe to your run list and specify what version should
be installed on the node:

`knife node run_list add recipe[omnibus_updater]`

In your role you'll likely want to set the version. It defaults
to nothing, and will install the latest..

```
override_attributes(
  :omnibus_updater => {
    :version => '11.4.0'
  }
)
```

It can also uninstall Chef from the system Ruby installation
if you tell it to:

```
override_attributes(
  :omnibus_updater => {
    :remove_chef_system_gem => true
  }
)
```

Features
========

Latest Version
--------------

Force installation of the latest version regardless of value stored in version
attribute by setting the `force_latest` attribute.

Chef Killing
------------

By default the omnibus updater will kill the chef instance by raising and exception.
You can turn this off using the `kill_chef_on_upgrade` attribute. It is not
recommended to turn this off. Internal chef libraries may change, move, or no
longer exist. The currently running instance can encounter unexpected states because
of this. To prevent this, the updater will attempt to kill the Chef instance so
that it can be restarted in a normal state.

Prerelease
--------

Prereleases can be installed via the auto-installation using `prerelease` attribute.

Disable
-------

If you want to disable the updater you can set the `disabled`
attribute to true. This might be useful if the cookbook is added
to a role but should then be skipped for example on a Chef server.
