# frozen_string_literal: true

##
# When we are attempting to notify users based on a message we have to take
# into account the following:
#
# * Individual user mentions like @alfred
# * Group mentions that include N users such as @support
# * Global @here and @all mentions
# * Users watching the channel via Chat::UserChatChannelMembership
#
# For various reasons a mention may not notify a user:
#
# * The target user of the mention is ignoring or muting the user who created the message
# * The target user either cannot chat or cannot see the chat channel, in which case
#   they are defined as `unreachable`
# * The target user is not a member of the channel, in which case they are defined
#   as `welcome_to_join`
# * In the case of global @here and @all mentions users with the preference
#   `ignore_channel_wide_mention` set to true will not be notified
#
# For any users that fall under the `unreachable` or `welcome_to_join` umbrellas
# we send a MessageBus message to the UI and to inform the creating user. The
# creating user can invite any `welcome_to_join` users to the channel. Target
# users who are ignoring or muting the creating user _do not_ fall into this bucket.
#
# The ignore/mute filtering is also applied via the Jobs::Chat::NotifyWatching job,
# which prevents desktop / push notifications being sent.
