          Every topic has a notification level. It starts at 'normal', which means you’ll normally only be notified when someone is speaking directly to you.

          By default, the notification level for a private message is set to the highest level of 'watching', which means you’ll be notified of every new reply. But you can override the notification level for _any_ topic to 'watch', 'tracking' or 'muted'.

          Let’s try changing the notification level for this topic. At the bottom of the topic, you’ll find a button which shows that you’re **watching** this topic. Can you change the notification level to **tracking**?

          It looks like you’re still watching :eyes: this topic! If you’re having trouble finding it, the notification level button is located at the bottom of the topic.

          Awesome work! I hope you didn’t mute this topic since I can be a little talkative at times :grin:.

          Note that when you reply to a topic, or read a topic for more than a few minutes, it is automatically set to a notification level of 'tracking'. You can change this in [your user preferences](%{base_uri}/my/preferences).

          Sometimes you may wish to **hide details** in your replies:

          - When you’re discussing plot points of a movie or TV show that would be considered a spoiler.

          - When your post needs lots of optional details that may be overwhelming when read all at once.
