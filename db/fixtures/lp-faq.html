<p>We welcome healthy, robust conversations. Among committed professionals, that can often mean disagreement or conflicting points of view. Feel free to express your disagreement or differences of opinion, but please do so in ways that keep lines of communication open.</p>

<p>If you witness bad behavior, do not encourage it by responding. Simply ignore or flag it. Ignoring it will avoid giving undue attention to those who behave poorly, thereby discouraging the negative behavior. If you encounter offensive or hate-based material, flagging it alerts moderators and the community of your concern.</p>
