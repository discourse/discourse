Given the advent of AI and the need for large datasets on local development machines, we have pulled together a quick pattern for getting a "workable" copy of all **public** (visible by anon) data from a Discourse forum.

Keeping the documentation up to date at:

### Why you care?

- You want a local database with LOTS of topics
- You don't want ANY personal data on your system

This is still in a very rough shape, but it is workable for initial experiments and gives you a very populous local setup.
