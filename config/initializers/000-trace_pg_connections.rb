# Setting TRACE_PG_CONNECTIONS=1 will cause all pg connections
# to be streamed to files for debugging. The filenames are formatted
# like tmp/pgtrace/{{PID}}_{{CONNECTION_OBJECT_ID}}.txt
#
# Setting TRACE_PG_CONNECTIONS=SIDEKIQ will only trace connections
# on in sidekiq (safer, because there will be minimal user-facing perf impact)
#
# Files will be automatically deleted when the connection is closed gracefully
# (e.g. when activerecord closes it after a period of inactivity)
# Files will not be automatically deleted when closed abruptly
# (e.g. terminating/restarting the app process)
#
# Warning: this could create some very large files!
