    'new-topic': |
      Welcome to %{site_name} &mdash; **thanks for starting a new conversation!**

      Keep in mind as you compose your topic:

      - Does the title accurately describe your topic? Does it sound interesting?

      - What is this about? Who would be interested in it? Why does it matter? What kind of responses are you hoping for from the community?

      - Include good search words in your topic so others can *find* it. To group your topic with related topics, select a category.

      For more guidance, [see our FAQ](/faq). This panel will only appear for your first %{education_posts_text}.

    'new-reply': |
      Welcome to %{site_name} &mdash; **thanks for contributing to the conversation!**

      Keep in mind as you compose your reply:

      - Does your reply improve the conversation in some way, however small?

      - Be kind to your fellow community members.

      - Constructive criticism is welcome, but remember to criticize *ideas*, not people.

      For more guidance, [see our FAQ](/faq). This panel will only appear for your first %{education_posts_text}.

    text_body_template: |
      This is a test email sent from your %{site_name} forum at:

      [**%{base_url}**][0]

      Email deliverability is complicated. Here are a few important things you should check first:

      - Know how to view the *raw source of the email* in your mail client, so you can examine the email headers for important clues. in Gmail, it is the "show original" option in the drop-down menu on each mail.

      - **IMPORTANT:** Does your ISP have a reverse DNS record entered to associate the domain names and IP addresses you send mail from? [Test your Reverse PTR record][2] here. If your ISP does not enter the proper reverse DNS pointer record, it's very unlikely any of your email will be delivered.

      - Is your domain's SPF record correct? [Test your SPF record][1] here.

      - Check to make sure the IPs of your mail server are [not on any email blacklists][4].

      - Verify that your email server is *definitely* sending a fully-qualified hostname that resolves in DNS in its HELO message. If not, this will cause your email to be rejected by many mail services.

       - Configure [DKIM email key signing][3] in your email software, and place the public DKIM key in your DNS records. This is not required, but will significantly improve email deliverability.

      We hope you received this email deliverability test OK!

      Good luck,

      Your friends at [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org)

        Hello,

        This is an automated message from %{site_name} to inform you that your post ...

        %{base_url}%{url}

        ... was hidden due to community flagging.

        Keep in mind that multiple community members flagged this post before it was hidden, so **please consider how you might revise your post to reflect their feedback.** You can edit your post after %{edit_delay} minutes, and it will be automatically unhidden. This will increase your forum trust level.

        However, if the post is hidden by the community a second time, the moderators will be notified -- and there may be further action, including the possible suspension of your account.

        For additional guidance, please refer to our [FAQ](%{base_url}/faq).

    usage_tips:
      text_body_template: |
        This private message has a few quick tips to get you started:

        ### Keep scrolling

        There are no next page buttons or page numbers – to read more, just keep scrolling down, and more content will load!

        As new replies come in, they will appear automatically at the bottom of the topic. No need to refresh the page or re-enter the topic to see new posts.

        ### How do I reply?

        - To reply to a specific post, use the Reply button at the bottom of that post.

        - If you want to reply to the overall *theme* of the topic, rather than any specific post in the topic, use the Reply button at the very bottom of the topic.

        - If you want to take the conversation in a different direction, but keep them linked together, use Reply as New Topic to the right of the post.

        ### Who is talking to me?

        When someone replies to your post, quotes you, or mentions your @username, a notification ➀ will appear at the top of the page. Click or tap that notification number to see who's talking to you, and where. Join the conversation!

        - To mention someone's name, start typing `@` and an autocompleter will pop up.

        - To quote just a section of a post, select it, then click the Reply button that appears over the highlight.

        - To quote an entire post, use the Import Quote button on the composer toolbar.

        ### Look at that post!

        To let someone know that you enjoyed their post, click the like ♥ button at the bottom of the post. If you see a problem with a post, don't hesitate to click the flag button and let the moderators – and your fellow community members – know about it.

        ### Where am I?

        - To get back to the home page at any time, **click the logo at the upper left** or use the back ← button on your browser.

        - For search, your user page, or the sitemap, click on the icons at the upper right.

        - While reading a topic, move to the top ↑ by clicking its title at the top of the page. To reach the *bottom* ↓, click the down arrow on the topic progress indicator at the bottom of the page, or click the last post field on the topic summary under the first post.
