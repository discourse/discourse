# Discourse supports multiple mechanisms for production config.
#
# 1. You can do nothing and get these defaults (not recommended, you should at least set hostname)
# 2. You can copy this file to config/discourse.conf and amend with your settings
# 3. You can pass in config from your environment, all the settings below are available.
#    Append DISCOURSE_ and upper case the setting in ENV. For example:
#    to pass in db_timeout of 200 you would use DISCOURSE_DB_TIMEOUT=200
