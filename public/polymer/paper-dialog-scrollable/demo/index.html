        <paper-dialog-scrollable>
          <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
          on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
          peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
          pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,'
          thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>
          <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
          for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
          the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
          of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
          Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
          <p>There was nothing so <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did
          Alice think it so <i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the
          Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when
          she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought
          to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
          natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of its
          waistcoat-pocket,</i> and looked at it, and then hurried on,
          Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that
          she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
          waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
          curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was
          just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
          hedge.</p>
          <p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
          considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>
          <p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
          and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a
          moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
          falling down a very deep well.</p>
          <p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for
          she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
          wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look
          down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to
          see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
          noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
          here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took
          down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled
          'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty:
          she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so
          managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past
          it.</p>
          <p>'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this,
          I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll
          all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even
          if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely
          true.)</p>
          <p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <i>never</i> come to an end!
          'I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said
          aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.
          Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--'
          (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in
          her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a <i>very</i>
          good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no
          one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
          '--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what
          Latitude or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what
          Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
          grand words to say.)</p>
          <p>Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right
          <i>through</i> the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among
          the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies,
          I think--' (she was rather glad there <i>was</i> no one listening, this
          time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) '--but I shall
          have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
          Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried
          to curtsey as she spoke--fancy <i>curtseying</i> as you're
          falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And
          what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No,
          it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up
          somewhere.'</p>
          <p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
          began talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I
          should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her
          saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down
          here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you
          might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do
          cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather
          sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way,
          'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat
          cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it
          didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was
          dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand
          in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now,
          Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly,
          thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves,
          and the fall was over.</p>
          <p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in
          a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her
          was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
          sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away
          went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as
          it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's
          getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but
          the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long,
          low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the
          roof.</p>
          <p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;
          and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
          other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
          wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p>
          <p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made
          of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
          and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the
          doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or
          the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of
          them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
          curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little
          door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key
          in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>
          <p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
          passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and
          looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
          How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about
          among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
          she could not even get her head though the doorway; 'and even if
          my head <i>would</i> go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would
          be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I
          could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know
          how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
          happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few
          things indeed were really impossible.</p>
          <p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so
          she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another
          key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up
          like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it,
          ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round
          the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK
          ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p>
          <p>It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little
          Alice was not going to do <i>that</i> in a hurry. 'No, I'll look
          first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked "<i>poison</i>" or
          not'; for she had read several nice little histories about
          children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other
          unpleasant things, all because they <i>would</i> not remember the
          simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a
          red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if
          you cut your finger <i>very</i> deeply with a knife, it usually
          bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from
          a bottle marked '<i>poison</i>,' it is almost certain to disagree
          with you, sooner or later.</p>
          <p>However, this bottle was <i>not</i> marked 'poison,' so Alice
          ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact,
          a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple,
          roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon
          finished it off.</p>
